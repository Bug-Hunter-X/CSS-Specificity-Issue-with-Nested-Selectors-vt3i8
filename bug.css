The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascade:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

#container {
  width: 600px;
}

.container #container {
  width: 700px;
}
```

The expected behavior might be that the element with the ID `container` would override the class selector `.container`, resulting in a width of 600px. However, the last selector `.container #container` is even more specific and will override the previous declarations resulting in 700px.

This situation can be particularly confusing when working with complex CSS layouts involving many selectors and nested elements, and may lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.
